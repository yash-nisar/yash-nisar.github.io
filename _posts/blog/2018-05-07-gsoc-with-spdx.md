## How It All Began ?
I had been contributing to 
[scancode-toolkit](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit) for quite a while
and it took me a few months to get accustomed to the codebase. It was the
12th February, 2018 and the list of accepted mentoring organizations was 
published. I booted up my laptop in excitement to give the list a glance. 
When I scrolled through, I was unable to find AboutCode 
(the organization I was contributing to) in the roll. I was devastated at the
unfortunate event and spent the next few hours pondering over my endeavour
since the past couple of months. 

I had always dreamt of becoming a DOUBLE GSOCER and I knew it wasn't going to
be easy. This would mean I would have to reiterate the entire process, i.e. 
shortlist an organization and start contributing from scratch ! After a heavy 
setback, I decided to continue with the struggle and not give up on my 
aspiration. I found
[SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange)](https://spdx.org/) which is an open 
standard for communicating software bill of material information 
(including components, copyrights, and security references). I spent the next
few weeks exploring the Python library to parse, validate and create SPDX 
documents and preparing mockups. Since the project involved lexing and 
parsing, I had to comprehend the fundamentals of compiler theory. Fast forward
to the judgement day; I was busy refreshing the GSoC page, in the middle of 
the road, with my friend to check the result and here's what it displayed:

Furthermore, I received a mail from Google confirming my selection for the 
paramount program.

## What's next ?
The community bonding period is almost over with just a week remaining. I have
almost completed upgrading the `Document` class and initiated a few bug fixes.
I would like to heartily thank my mentors 
[@pombredanne](https://github.com/pombredanne) and 
[@krysnuvadga](https://github.com/krysnuvadga) for keeping faith in me 
throughout the process and giving me the opportunity to be a part of the SPDX 
community. I'm super excited to spend this summer with SPDX and intend to use 
this blog to post updates and developments.
