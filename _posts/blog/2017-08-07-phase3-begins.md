We've finally managed to clear the Phase 2 evaluations.

The last phase i.e. Phase 3 has begun and we're off with a good start.

## New bear additions
We've introduced 2 bears with 1 bear remaining. Go check them out and
report bugs if you've found any :P.

#### CSSCombBear
CSScomb is a coding style formatter for CSS. You can easily write your own
configuration to make your style sheets beautiful and consistent.

#### HTTPoliceLintBear
HTTPolice is a linter for HTTP requests and responses. It checks them for
conformance to standards and best practices.

#### HTMLHintBear (Work in Progress)
Checks HTML code with ``htmlhint`` for possible problems. Attempts to catch
little mistakes and enforces a code style guide on HTML files.

## Conclusion
We're planning for some crucial bug fixes. This wouldn't have been possible
without my mentor [@Makman2](https://github.com/Makman2). I'm forward to the
final evaluations and I hope everything turns out well.
