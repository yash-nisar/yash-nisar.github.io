## Project proposal accepted for GSoC'17
GSoC had always been an unachievable dream for me. After a few
months of reduced sleep and increased caffeine, I'm really happy to state
that I have been selected to work with
[coala](https://coala.io/#!/home) for
[GSoC 2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). My project comprises of
wrapping third party linters and improving the testing API to yield useful
results.

## What is Google Summer of Code ?
[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global
program focused on introducing students to open source software development.
Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source
organization during their break from university.

As a part of Google Summer of Code, student participants are paired with a
mentor from the participating organizations, gaining exposure to real-world
software development and techniques. Students have the opportunity to spend
the break between their school semesters earning a stipend while working in
areas related to their interests.

## About coala
[coala](https://coala.io/#!/home) is a free and open-source language independent
analysis toolkit, written in
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).
The primary goal of coala is to make it easier for developers to create rules
which a project's code should conform to.

coala provides a unified interface for linting and fixing code with a single
configuration file, regardless of the programming languages used. You can use
coala from within your favorite editor, integrate it with your CI, get the
results as JSON, or customize it to your needs with its flexible configuration
syntax.

## My experience with coala so far
I started contributing sincerely in the early week of January. coala is the best
newcomer friendly organization that I've ever come across. Newcomers are
welcomed and guided by our community members and we have an awesome
[Newcomers Guide](http://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Newcomers_Guide.html)
to get them started. I seemed to struggle a lot during the initial phase and it
took 5 months to get my first `difficulty/low`
[Pull Request](https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/3559) merged. The first
step is always the hardest.

I moved on to accept the challenge of
[writing a bear](http://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Linter_Bears.html)
and I have not stopped yet. There is always scope of progress when you have
awesome maintainers like [@Makman2](https://github.com/Makman2),
[@jayvdb](https://github.com/jayvdb) and all the fellow coalians who
review your code. My learning curve has been exponential and programming for
coala has become an integral part of my life. Surprisingly,
while going the github and gitlab pulse, I found out that I was the most active
contributor for the [coala-bears](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears) and
second most active for the
[dependency_management](https://gitlab.com/coala/package_manager)
repository. The overall experience has been outstanding and I thank the entire
coala community from the bottom of my heart for keeping me motivated.

## What's more ?
I'm looking forward to having a productive summer with coala and plan to use
this blog to post updates and developments. Feel free to contact me for any
queries/questions regarding GSoC and I'll be more than happy to answer them.
Thats all folks ! Stay tuned.
